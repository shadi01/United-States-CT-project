# United-States-terrorist-data-analysis

This is a data analysis project that analyzes United States domestic terrorist attack data from 1970 - 2017. I used python to visualize, manipulate, and clean the data. I also provide my own analysis using historical context and my understanding of extremism/terrorism to provide actionable information.
